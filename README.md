# Password Strength Evaluation 

## 📌 Objective

The main goal of this project is to understand and analyze password strength through generation, testing, and evaluation. This helps reinforce good security practices and highlights the importance of creating complex, hard-to-crack passwords.

## 📖 Overview

I generated multiple passwords with varying complexities and tested them using a password strength checker tool. The results were then documented to identify the characteristics of strong passwords and understand how password complexity enhances security. I also researched common password attacks and compiled key takeaways.
